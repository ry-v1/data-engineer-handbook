# Week 5 Data Pipeline Maintenance

### On call runbook for Data Pipeline Maintenance

#### Ownership Assignments

To ensure accountability and expertise, I have assigned primary and secondary owners for each pipeline, taking into account their strengths, expertise, and roles within the business areas:

* **Profit Pipelines**
	+ Unit-level profit: Primary - **John** (has experience with experiment design and data analysis, and is familiar with profit metrics), Secondary - **Emily** (has a strong understanding of financial reporting and investor relations, and can provide support with data analysis)
	+ Aggregate profit: Primary - **Emily** (has expertise in financial reporting and investor relations, and is responsible for ensuring accurate and timely reporting), Secondary - **John** (can provide support with data analysis and experiment design, and has a deep understanding of profit metrics)
* **Growth Pipelines**
	+ Aggregate growth: Primary - **Michael** (has a deep understanding of user acquisition and retention strategies, and is responsible for driving growth initiatives), Secondary - **David** (has experience with data analysis and metrics reporting, and can provide support with growth strategy and user acquisition)
	+ Daily growth: Primary - **David** (has a strong background in data analysis, and is responsible for providing timely insights on daily growth metrics), Secondary - **Michael** (can provide support with growth strategy and user acquisition, and has a deep understanding of growth metrics)
* **Engagement Pipeline**
	+ Aggregate engagement: Primary - **John** (has experience with experiment design and data analysis, and is familiar with engagement metrics), Secondary - **Emily** (can provide support with reporting and investor relations, and has a strong understanding of engagement metrics)

The ownership assignments were made based on the following factors:

* **Expertise**: Each team member's expertise and experience in specific business areas or technical skills.
* **Role**: Each team member's role within the company and their responsibilities.
* **Workload**: The distribution of workload across team members to ensure that no one person is overwhelmed.
* **Development**: The opportunity for team members to develop new skills and take on new challenges.

#### On-Call Schedule

To ensure fair and reliable coverage, I have developed a two-week on-call rotation schedule, with considerations for holidays and backup support:

* Week 1-2: John (primary), Emily (secondary)
* Week 3-4: Emily (primary), Michael (secondary)
* Week 5-6: Michael (primary), David (secondary)
* Week 7-8: David (primary), John (secondary)

For holiday coverage, the following adjustments will be made:

* If a holiday falls on a weekday, the primary on-call engineer will cover the holiday, and the secondary engineer will provide backup support.
* If a holiday falls on a weekend, the primary on-call engineer will cover the holiday, and the secondary engineer will provide backup support.
* If a holiday falls in the middle of a rotation, the primary on-call engineer will cover the holiday, and the secondary engineer will provide backup support. The rotation will then resume as scheduled.

#### Runbooks

The runbooks for each pipeline will include the following information:

* **Purpose**: A brief description of the pipeline's purpose and the metrics it reports.
* **Metrics**: A list of the metrics reported by the pipeline, including any relevant calculations or transformations.
* **Frequency**: The frequency at which the pipeline runs, including any relevant scheduling or timing information.
* **SLAs**: The expected response times for resolving key issues, including:
	+ Critical issues: 1-hour response time, 4-hour resolution time
	+ Major issues: 2-hour response time, 8-hour resolution time
	+ Minor issues: 4-hour response time, 24-hour resolution time
* **On-Call Procedure**: A brief outline of the steps to take when an issue arises, including:
	+ Notification: The primary on-call engineer will be notified of the issue via email and phone.
	+ Assessment: The primary on-call engineer will assess the issue and determine the severity.
	+ Resolution: The primary on-call engineer will work to resolve the issue, with support from the secondary engineer as needed.

The runbooks will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that they remain accurate and effective.

#### Potential Issues

The following potential issues could arise in these pipelines:

* **Data Quality Issues**
	+ Inconsistent or missing data
	+ Incorrect data formatting
* **Pipeline Failures**
	+ Pipeline crashes or errors
	+ Dependency issues with upstream or downstream pipelines
* **Scalability Issues**
	+ Increased data volume or velocity causing pipeline bottlenecks
	+ Insufficient resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to handle pipeline workload
* **Security Issues**
	+ Unauthorized access to pipeline data or metrics
	+ Data breaches or leaks
* **Dependency Issues**
	+ Changes to upstream or downstream pipelines causing compatibility issues
	+ Version conflicts with dependencies or libraries
