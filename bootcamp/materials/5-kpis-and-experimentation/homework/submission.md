# Revised Submission for YouTube's KPIs and Experimentation

## User Journey

As a frequent user of YouTube, I have found the platform to be an invaluable resource for entertainment, education, and inspiration. One of the features that has greatly enhanced my experience is the recommendation algorithm, which has introduced me to new channels and content creators that I may not have discovered otherwise. For example, I stumbled upon a channel that focused on DIY home improvement projects, which sparked my interest and led me to explore more content in that area.

Another feature that has created value for me is the playlist management system. I have created several playlists for different genres of music and topics, which allows me to easily access and share my favorite content with others. Additionally, the subscription management system has made it easy for me to keep track of my favorite channels and receive notifications when they upload new content.

However, there have been moments when I felt that the platform could be improved. For instance, I have encountered situations where I wanted to bookmark a specific moment in a video, but the platform did not provide that functionality. This led me to wonder if there were other users who shared similar needs and if the platform could be improved to address them.

## Experiment Design

### Experiment 1: A Section for New and Upcoming Channels

* **Test Design**: We will allocate 50% of users to the control group and 50% to the test group. The test group will have access to a new section in the "Explore" tab that features new and upcoming channels.
* **Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that the introduction of a specialized section for new and upcoming channels will increase engagement and discovery of new content.
* **Metrics**:
	+ Leading metrics:
		- Interaction with the new section (e.g., clicks, views)
		- Growth of featured channels (e.g., increase in subscribers, views)
	+ Lagging metrics:
		- User feedback and ratings on the new section
		- Impact on overall user engagement across the platform (e.g., changes in daily active users, time spent on the feature)

### Experiment 2: Ability to Bookmark Favorite Moments in a Video

* **Test Design**: We will allocate 50% of users to the control group and 50% to the test group. The test group will have access to a new feature that allows them to bookmark favorite moments in a video.
* **Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that the ability to bookmark favorite moments in a video will enhance user engagement and content sharing.
* **Metrics**:
	+ Leading metrics:
		- Number of users utilizing the bookmark feature
		- Frequency of shares or interactions with bookmarked moments
	+ Lagging metrics:
		- User feedback on the bookmark feature
		- Impact on subscriber conversion rate for engaged users (e.g., new vs. returning subscribers)

### Experiment 3: Ability to Add Subtitles for Videos

* **Test Design**: We will allocate 50% of users to the control group and 50% to the test group. The test group will have access to a new feature that allows them to add subtitles for videos.
* **Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that providing an option to add subtitles will enhance accessibility and increase viewership from non-native speakers.
* **Metrics**:
	+ Leading metrics:
		- Number of users utilizing the subtitle feature
		- Frequency of subtitle usage (e.g., number of times subtitles are enabled or disabled)
	+ Lagging metrics:
		- User feedback on the subtitle feature
		- Impact on engagement metrics (e.g., increased watch time with subtitles)

## Overall Impact

The proposed experiments aim to improve the user experience on YouTube by addressing specific needs and pain points. By providing a new section for new and upcoming channels, we hope to increase discovery and engagement. By introducing the ability to bookmark favorite moments in a video, we aim to enhance user engagement and content sharing. Finally, by providing an option to add subtitles for videos, we hope to enhance accessibility and increase viewership from non-native speakers.
